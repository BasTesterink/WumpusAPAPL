1) Start your 2apl interpreter (use option no-jade)
2) Open config.mas
3) Select the world you want to use, examples are standard_wumpus and other_world
4) If the 2apl interpreter is not in the same directory as the MAS, select the icon directory (that being ./resources/icons)
5) Run the agent (hit the play button)

Worlds specifications always start with the dimensions of the world. The coordinates of the 
specifications start at 0. Maximally four agents are allowed. The 2apl files are tailored for
1 agent starting at (1,1). 

All example code belongs to the 2apl distribution and falls under the same licenses. Images from
this example were not self-made. Check the icon directory for re-usage of them (in general they
are free for non-commercial use).

If you want to compile the source of the java part you will need to reference to a 2apl
interpreter as a library. A build of the source from apapl.sourceforge.net will do.

For questions see apapl.sourceforge.net or mail to the author of this example:
